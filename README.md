📊 Decoding Emotions Through Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Conversation
This project aims to analyze and decode the emotional tone of social media conversations using machine learning techniques. By processing text from platforms like Twitter and Reddit, it classifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral—providing insights into public opinion and emotional trends.

🧠 Objective
To build a sentiment analysis system capable of:

Extracting and preprocessing social media text.

Classifying sentiments using machine learning/NLP models.

Visualizing emotional patterns across different datasets.

🚀 How to Run
Data Preprocessing
Clean, tokenize, and normalize text using scripts/preprocess.py.

Model Training
Train your classifier using notebooks/train_model.ipynb or run scripts/train.py.

Evaluation & Visualization
Generate confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and sentiment trend charts.

📊 Example Output
Sentiment classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).

Word clouds for positive/negative tweets.

Time-series of emotional sentiment shifts.

📈 Future Enhancements
Incorporate deep learning models (e.g., BERT, LSTM).

Multilingual sentiment analysis.

Real-time dashboard using Streamlit or Flask.

Emotion classification beyond sentiment (e.g., joy, anger, fear).
